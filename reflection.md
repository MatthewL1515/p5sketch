# First Sketch Reflection

[Assignment Page](https://avenues.instructure.com/courses/7407/assignments/119412)

When I began creating the sketch, I intended for it to represent my profile picture on GitHub: a person in a red spacesuit on an orange planet, with white clouds in the background. It was challenging at first because I hadn't fully realized how to position the shapes correctly while drawing a sketch, therefore I had to reposition most of the rectangles and circles, as well as change their sizes. For example, earlier, I thought that the x and y coordinates for all the shapes were the center point, but that was only the case for circles and ellipses, not rectangles and squares. It makes more sense to me know about how to position shapes in a P5 sketch. I feel somewhat proud of it because it represents my profile picture somewhat, but I would like to learn more about P5 to use more shapes and background in the image.
